This was written by following this tutorial https://medium.com/@danielzen/build-a-todo-app-with-angular-material-and-the-angular-cli-d6340cb9ed31

from this code:

https://github.com/danielzen/material-todo/tree/dialog

However the tutorial and code are out of date and don't work with the lastest angular-material, so I updated it.

My goal in working with the tutorial was to improve my angular test writing skills, so I have also added tests.



# MaterialApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
